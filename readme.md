## User Experience
### Project Goals
The core objective of this project is to entice people into signing up and playing in five-a-side football league, based in Canterbury, Kent.
The league features professionally arranged matches with a clear league structure, complete with rules, regulations and league tables.
Qualified and experienced referees also officiate the games, ensuring matches are fair and held to high standards.

### User Goals

This project fulfills the needs of two groups. The first and primary target audience are the players. Referees are another target group, but to a much lesser extent.

#### Players
The players are the core primary audience as they are the lifeblood of the league. Without them, the league will not be a sustainable, profitable and viable business. Therefore, the website caters for them first and foremost.

The website project targets new users with a modern and professional design that entices them to sign up. This is done by utilising deliberate design choices such as red and blue colours and using images of people playing football to help
stir up emotions of comradery of being in a team and fulfilling childhood dreams of winning trophies like their footballing heroes. Further information on this can be found in the Design Choices section. 

New users are able to see evidence of a well run and organised league. They can see recent results and the current league table. For returning users they'll also make use of this feature, but this will come with self-interest in that they
will be able to see the current league position of their team.

#### Referees
While the matches competitive and referees are paid a match fee for their time, it's important that referees can have the confidence that the league is run in proper way.

Referees need to know that their appointments will be made in advance and that they will be treated with respect by the players in matches when making decisions. This is particularly important as some decisions can change the game such
as penalties, free kicks, sin bins and red cards. 

Much of this won't be achieved using this project, but the visuals will help to present an image of a professionally run league that acts fairly to its various stakeholders. For functionality, there will be a form with ease-of-use in mind
for them to apply and become an official affiliated with the league, making them eligible for match appointments.
